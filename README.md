# Lexicon
Quick script to look up the definition of a word or its synonyms. Useful when working on things like writing or reading news articles.

&nbsp;

## How to use
Run it in the background via command line:

```bash
sudo python lexicon.py
```

&nbsp; 

When you come across a word you want to look up, copy it to the clipboard:

<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>

&nbsp; 

If you want to get the definition, use the corresponding shortcut:

<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>g</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd>

&nbsp; 

If you want to get the synonyms, use the corresponding shortcut:

<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>g</kbd> + <kbd>y</kbd>

&nbsp; 

This action will launch a window with a list definitions/synonyms from the vocabulary.com/synonym.com page pertaining to the word.
